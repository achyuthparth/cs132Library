unit tests:

complete:
    transaction encoded into json object
    item store logic and unit testing with edge cases
    transaction unit tested
    patrons unit tested with edge cases

questions:
    why, when decoding, the json.load is loading the objects correctly but at the end seems to load the whole dictionary?
    where do I store the book logic?
    can I just make a single user class and set roles later? how would I plan that?
