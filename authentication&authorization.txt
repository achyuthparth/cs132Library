authentication is the process of verifying the identity (usually done through login)
authorization is the process of verifying whether the user has privileges to preform an action (done at the time of action)
    form of mapping (dictionary)
        key: action name (checkout book)
        value: who is allowed (patron can checkout) (librarian can create patron) (allowed list aka access control)
    method needs to check who the use is and block based on block-list

Roles – A collection of permissions. Roles are assigned to users. Example roles: Administrator, Editor, Guest etc.
Permissions – Authorization to perform certain operations like view, edit, delete etc. Permissions are grouped under roles.
Users – Individual users in the system. Users can be assigned multiple roles.
Sessions – Mapping between user and their activated role(s) for a login session.

use decorators to check if the user type is correctly

def roles_required():
            if type(user) == Librarian:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            else:
                raise Exception('User is not admin')
@roles_required('admin')
def delete_user(user_id):
    user = User.get(user_id)
    user.delete()

questions about process:
    I will create an admin class to represent permissions, roles, modeling users and sessions, and checking access

roles.json
permissions.json
role_permissions.json (explicitly granted, explicitly denied) (access control list)
i can have only explicit granting in my program

roles.json is the roles master table
	new definitions of roles will be stored here
permissions.json is the permissions master table
	new operations and permissions will be entered here first
managing permissions at the role level will be changed at the role_permmissions.json file
add role and delete role would be static methods
